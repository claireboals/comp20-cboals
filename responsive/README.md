# Lab 4: Responsive Design
Claire Boals

I believe everything in this lab was implemented correctly. The only thing I am
unsure of is the formatting of my CSS file. The lines are long, but I was not
sure of the best way to format the file since I found so many different
examples online. Also, I struggled a lot with git. I was repeatedly denied
access to push to the branch when using the command "git push" as given on
the lab spec. I deleted and re-added the remote repo through the command
line and unfortunately uploaded some files twice and some outside of the
responsive folder. I will try to manually fix this since I don't want to 
mess anything else up further with git on the command line.

I ended up having to remove everything and start again. I could not get my
files to push after committing them, then suddenly I could push but I was
too many commits behind, so many files were removed. I just pulled master 
again (which only had the readme at that point) and recommitted and pushed
the other files.

I did not collaborate on this assignment. This lab took about an hour for me
to complete.
