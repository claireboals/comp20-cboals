COMP 20 Fall 2018 Private Repo for Claire Boals

What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)
This repository has my work from the Fall 2018 Comp20 Web Programming class led
by Ming Chow.

What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
My favorite assignment was the responsive assignment because I found it both
easy and fun to make the page react to the size of the window, and I hadn't
known that just HTML and CSS could do that much on their own.

How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
I've grown much more than I expected, because I have gained skills that 
relate to all types of programming (working on teams, using git, 
researching the internet for debugging help). I feel more like a 
programmer now that I am so familiar with so many useful and common tools
in the industry.

What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
I've learned how to write serverside code, how to deploy web apps 
through Heroku, and track changes with git and GitHub. I believe these are
the most useful things I've learned so far since they are so adaptable for
use in the industry/on my own later on in other classes or in general.

Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
I'd like to learn more about UX and design, such has how to design websites
well. I'd also like to learn more about frontend technologies that could
make design easier in the future.
