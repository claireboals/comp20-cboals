# Assignment 4
Claire Boals

I believe I have completed the assignment correctly, although since all the
vulnerabilities I have found were related to cross-site scripting, it is very
possible that I missed something. However, I do believe that the issues related
to cross-site scripting that I did find were described correctly.

I did not work with anyone on this assignment.

I spent about 2 hours completing this assignment.
