# Claire Boals A2

I believe most of this has been implemented correctly, however because of
Wollaston being closed I ran into an error parsing data from stops on
the Redline past Wollaston. Also, arrival times are sometimes null, and they
will display that way in the window. Lastly, the arrival and departure
times are not formatted very nicely. Otherwise, everything has been
implemented correctly.

I did not collaborate on this project with anyone. Piazza and StackOverflow
both provided lots of help.

I spent approximately 7 hours on this assignment.
