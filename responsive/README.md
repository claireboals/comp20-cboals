# Lab 4: Responsive Design
Claire Boals

I believe everything in this lab was implemented correctly. The only thing I am
unsure of is the formatting of my CSS file. The lines are long, but I was not
sure of the best way to format the file since I found so many different
examples online. Also, I was able to add and commit my files with git, but
whenever I tried to push with "git push" I was denied access, so I had to
manually upload my files. 

I did not collaborate on this assignment. This lab took about an hour for me
to complete.
